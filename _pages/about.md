I am a PhD student at [UC Berkeley](https://physics.berkeley.edu/). My research lies in the intersection of fundmantal physics and machine learning. I am currently interested in applying various types of neural networks to model-agnostic anomaly detection on particle collision data collected from the LHC.

Before studying at Berkeley, I completed graduate coursework in Physics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/), preceded by a Bachelor's degree (in guess what) at [MIT](https://physics.mit.edu/).

Outside of my research, I am an [APS DSECOP](https://dsecop.org/) Fellow, where I develop coursework that integrates data science and machine learning with early-stage undergraduate physics curriculum. You can view the fellows' work at [this repository](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP).
