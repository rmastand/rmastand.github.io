I am an [APS DSECOP](https://dsecop.org/) Fellow, which is associated with the APS Group of Data Science. Five other fellows and I have been working to develop coursework aimed at undergraduates in topics such as machine learning and data science. The aim is that these modules could be integrated as-is (or with minimal changes) into existing physics courses such that undergraduates can be exposed to machine learning in a practical setting as early as possible.

The module that I have been working on is called [Introduction to Data Processing](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Intro_to_Data_Processing), and it covers basics topics such as creating histograms, curve fitting the distributions, and evaluating the goodness-of-fit. If you would like to use my module in your course, or if you have any suggestions about improvements or additions to the module, please don't hesitate to contact me!
