## APS Data Science Education Community of Practice

In 2022, I was a [APS DSECOP](https://dsecop.org/) Fellow, which is associated with the APS Group of Data Science. Two cohorts of fellows have developed coursework aimed at undergraduates in topics such as machine learning and data science. The aim is for these modules to be integrated as-is (or with minimal changes) into existing physics courses such that undergraduates can be exposed to machine learning in a practical setting as early as possible. You can find all of the modules at the [DSECOP Github](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main).

I worked on two modules:

1. [Introduction to Data Processing with Histograms](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Intro_to_Data_Processing_with_Histograms) covers basics topics such as creating histograms, curve fitting the distributions, and evaluating the goodness-of-fit.

2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/GDS-Education-Community-of-Practice/DSECOP/tree/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis) goes through the often-neglected process of quickly getting acquainted with an unfamiliar dataset in order to guide future analyses.

If you would like to use either of my modules in your course, or if you have any suggestions about improvements or additions to the module, please don't hesitate to contact me!


## Interactive notebooks explaining physics phenomena

I am working on a series of interactive jupyter / google colab notebooks to teach interesting phenomena in physics at the upper high school / lower undergraduate level. My goal is that each notebook takes no longer than an hour (ideally half of that) to go through.

- [The Hot Chocolate Effect](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LyZ6br5LUvOVFqZIbYjQr7v5XIx98w5a?usp=sharing). This was my entry to the [3Blue1Brown Summer of Math 2022 Competition](https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some2), and it was selected as one of the top 100 entries!

## Databases of consumables

I am a big fan of objectively ranking consumables. 

- [Ritter Sport flavors](https://spiced-belief-ae1.notion.site/0952ab97637248fea27d131c56eec6f9?v=338ccef6434f4337a18e15843ae2e2c6&pvs=74). This database was created over a 6-month research trip in Germany. I know that the list is not complete and that there are very niche flavors that I could nto find (even after a trip to the Waldenbuch factory!). I will pay very good money to anyone who can get me a flavor *not* listed.

- [Cafes in Berkeley](https://spiced-belief-ae1.notion.site/Cafe-Database-IN-PROGRESS-24597b37fec9425cb04a693c8f606393). A growing database of all the coffee shops in the Berkeley area.
