## Databases of consumables

I am a big fan of objectively ranking consumables. 

- [Ritter Sport flavors](https://spiced-belief-ae1.notion.site/0952ab97637248fea27d131c56eec6f9?v=338ccef6434f4337a18e15843ae2e2c6&pvs=74). This database was created over a 6-month time period that I spent visiting the ML ITP Heidelberg group. I know that the list is not complete and that there are very niche flavors that I could not find (even after a trip to the Waldenbuch factory!). I will pay *very good money* to anyone who can get me a flavor not listed.

- [Cafes in Berkeley](https://spiced-belief-ae1.notion.site/Cafe-Database-IN-PROGRESS-24597b37fec9425cb04a693c8f606393). A growing database of all the coffee shops in the Berkeley area. It is still growing, but I hope to be done with it by May 2025.
