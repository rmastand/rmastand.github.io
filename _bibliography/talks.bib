I analyze a sample of jets from 2.3/fb of 7 TeV proton-proton collisions detected by the CMS experiment in 2011 with the companion simulated (both pre- and post-detector) datasets, focusing on a high-quality sample of jets with transverse momenta restricted to between 375 and 425 GeV. I further move to a specific analysis of jet classification using the unsupervised algorithm of jet topics to provide a new way of defining the categories of quark and gluon jets through their observable properties.",
