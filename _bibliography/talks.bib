    abstract = "We investigate a method of model-agnostic anomaly detection at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through studying jets, collimated sprays of particles produced in high-energy collisions. We train a transformer neural network to encode simulated quark and gluon ("physical-space") di-jets into a high-dimensional ("latent-space") representation. We optimize the representations using the contrastive loss, which tells the transformer to preserve known physical symmetries of the di-jet when making its representations. We then run a signal (consisting of di-jets from simulated new particles) vs. background (di-jets from quarks and gluons) linear classifier test on the latent-space representations and compare the classifier performance with that of a dense binary classifier neural net trained on the physical-space di-jets. We finally explore the possibility of using the transformer net to encode LHC events at the event level -- rather than at the jet level -- into the latent space. Such a representation makes no assumptions on the relationships between particles in a given event while still enforcing known physical symmetries for particle collision events on the whole. This could provide a maximally agnostic event representation that could be used to search for new physics of any type."

I analyze a sample of jets from 2.3/fb of 7 TeV proton-proton collisions detected by the CMS experiment in 2011 with the companion simulated (both pre- and post-detector) datasets, focusing on a high-quality sample of jets with transverse momenta restricted to between 375 and 425 GeV. I further move to a specific analysis of jet classification using the unsupervised algorithm of jet topics to provide a new way of defining the categories of quark and gluon jets through their observable properties.",

    abstract = "The recent detections of gravitational waves (GWs) by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) have provided researchers with the first opportunities to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field and highly-dynamical limit. Qualitative tests of the agreement between LIGO's GW observations and classical GR have already been done; we have carried out more quantitative tests in terms of controlled, parameterized deviations from GR. In this project, we simulate a number of binary black hole (BBH) merger waveforms with known amplitude and phase deviations from those predicted by GR that are governed by the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of a complex parameter ùúÜ. We use Bayesian analysis to recover the deviation. We then provide an estimate of the number of GW detections from BBH mergers that are necessary to establish a given deviation from classical GR, notably finding that under 80 events are necessary to determine ùúÜ to a precision of 0.025 (a fractional precision of 5\% for ùúÜ=0.5).",
